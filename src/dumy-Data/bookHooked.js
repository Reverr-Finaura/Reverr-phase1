His "Fogg Behavior Model" can be expressed using the formula "B=MAT" – that is, "Behavior" occurs when adequate "Motivation," "Ability," and "a Trigger" are present. You hear your phone ring, for example. You can let the call go to voice mail if you buried it at the bottom of your handbag or briefcase. Perhaps you have your phone set to quiet and never hear it ring. A weak or absent component of the formula prevents the action from taking place.',

            'Users are more inclined to stick with a product they put more thought and effort into utilising. They are kept hooked by the accumulation of "stored value" in the form of "information, data, followers, reputation, and expertise." For instance, after users accumulate a music library on iTunes, they are hesitant to switch to another service and start over. Users are less likely to switch to another website after posting their resumes and updating their profiles on LinkedIn. On websites like eBay, TaskRabbit, and Airbnb, people seek to establish a solid reputation. They are reluctant to give up a high rating once they have obtained it.',

By presenting a variety of visually appealing images, the website first provides a diversion from boredom. New users like surfing, and by commenting and submitting photographs, they make social connections. As users save photographs, their time investment fosters loyalty, and their value is what keeps them clicking. When other users publish or remark on their content, that acts as an outside trigger to keep users around for another cycle.',

Evaluate your hook strategies on a regular basis to see how you\'re doing. Try out several approaches and concepts, then evaluate how well they encourage the user behaviour you want to see. For your analysis, follow the \"Habit Testing\" process in three steps. First, think about how frequently you anticipate your average consumer using your product and what constitutes normal or excessive usage. Determine how many people you\'ll need to have in order for your firm to be successful before categorising this use. Then, alter your strategy to convert casual users into fervent followers who form a habit.',
