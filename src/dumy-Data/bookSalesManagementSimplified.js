            'In most companies, sales managers have virtually no control over their time or calendars and often must waste time handling petty tasks and attending meetings that have nothing to do with sales. The time sales managers devote to unrelated activities and other distractions often prevents them from leading their sales teams more effectively and generating new business. Corporate duties force many sales managers to abandon sales management basics – coaching and mentoring salespeople, running sales meetings, working with salespeople in the field, and so on. Sales consultant Mike Weinberg details how sales managers can regain control and propel their teams to better sales. He also shows CEOs how to develop and sustain sales­friendly corporate cultures.',
