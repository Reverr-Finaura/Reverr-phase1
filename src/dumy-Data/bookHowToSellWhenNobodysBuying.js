            'When it comes to selling during a recession, taking bold, proactive action may be necessary to ensure your company\'s existence. Desperate times call for desperate means. Dave Lakhani, a speaker, author, and sales trainer, argues that traditional sales methods are no longer effective. In addition to some audacious, though maybe clichéd, ploys, he suggests alternate, creative techniques to marketing. Unfortunately, the book is frequently bland ("The ideal moment to sell more is when people are buying") and highly self-­referential, and some of its sales strategies may come across to certain clients as being unduly pushy. For salespeople who want to build or enhance their personal brands, interact with prospects, and work more effectively, we find that Lakhani offers unique suggestions and a wealth of useful online tools.',

Everyone joins the party and rides the sales train. However, it might be challenging to sell during contractions and recessions. Conventional sales strategies that were effective in the good times won\'t work during a recession. As a result, many salespeople who stick to tried-and-true techniques for closing deals can conclude that "nobody\'s buying" and give up their jobs. However, economic downturns present a fantastic chance for "entrepreneurial salespeople." The sales gap left by other suppliers might be filled by diligent sellers. What else could we be doing that nobody else is doing? is the simple question that these survivors must ask themselves. To kick-start your sales, take some "high-value, high-impact acts."',

Dr. Rachna Jain, a specialist in social marketing, provided the following strategy.\n\n- Choose the social media tools that will be helpful to you and how you will evaluate the results.\n\n- Create a \"DPT profile\" for your ideal client. Age, income, and other demographics, motivational factors, and technographics—the extent to which your prospects will \"be immersed in the social media space\"—are all taken into consideration.
