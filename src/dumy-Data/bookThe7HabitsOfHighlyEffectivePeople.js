Covey had to repackage an ethical and moral heritage that had evolved over thousands of years. Aristotle, Cicero, Benedict, Tillotson, and their heirs are where you'll discover the majority of the information in this book. A few references to psychology, a science of the 20th century, and numerous allusions to Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust sage, are added by Covey. ",
